# Style Guide

## References

- [The Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
- [PEP-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/)

Take cues from the above references, then use linters, auto-formatters, and LLMs to enforce the styles.

## Notes

- Run `pylint` with the `pylintrc` file (from the Google Python Style Guide) in the root directory:
  ```sh
  pylint --rcfile=pylintrc orbitpy tests examples
  ```

- Run `black` to format the python files.
  ```sh
  black orbitpy tests examples
  ```
- Run `coverage`. The HTML report will be generated in the htmlcov directory. Open htmlcov/index.html in a web browser to view the detailed coverage report.
    ```sh
    coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests
    coverage html
    ```

- Use Google style docstrings.  https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html. The following configuration option in the `conf.py` enables Sphinx to parse Google style dosctrings:  `napoleon_google_docstring = True`

- All OrbitPy objects (classes) intended for use by external users must support initialization and serialization using Python dictionaries. Each class should provide `from_dict(...)` and `to_dict(...)` methods to allow instantiation from dictionary inputs and export their state or data back into a dictionary format.

- Only classes and functions which are most commonly utiized in Earth Observation mission simulations will be developed.

- All enum values should be in capital letters and formatted with underscores, e.g., `GREGORIAN_DATE`.

- Imports of classes and/or functions from external libraries must be prefixed by the name of the external library. For example:
  ```python
  from astropy.time import Time as Astropy_Time # for imported classes use upper-case for the first letter in the underscore seperated seperated words
  from skyfield.positionlib import build_position as skyfield_build_position # for function use all lower case
  ```

- Always use from_dict(...) and other public API functions to initialize EO-Sim objects, including in test functions. Avoid directly calling internal methods or the __init__(...) constructor. This ensures compatibility with future updates, as internal implementations may change, but the public API is expected to remain stable.

- A class representing a physical object (e.g., Ground-station, instrument, spcacecraft) or a collection of objects (e.g., grid of physical locations) must include an identifier attribute which must be a valid UUID. If no identifier is provided, one will be autogenerated. Providing names of entities will be optional.

- Python dictionaries used for interfacing will have lowercase, underscore-separated keys. Avoid including units in keys for physical quantities. Examples: `min_elevation_angle`, `latitude` (not `latitude_deg`). The class variable names will be descriptive and have units.

- Seperate tests which take a long time into a seperate long-duration-test folder, to give the flexibility to seperately run the long tests.

- Numpy arrays are used for storing numerical array-like data (e.g., 3d position, states, trajectories, etc.) 
  At several places functions are built to have two versions: one which takes `eosimutils` objects and another which takes numpy arrays.

- Use factory methods in modules such as orbits, propagator, etc. This allows for dynamic creation of propagators based on input specifications in a dictionary. It centralizes the registration and creation of propagator types, making the system extensible and maintainable.
