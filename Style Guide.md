# Style Guide

## References

- [The Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
- [PEP-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/)

Take cues from the above references, then use linters, auto-formatters, and LLMs to enforce the styles.

## Notes

- Run `pylint` with the `pylintrc` file (from the Google Python Style Guide) in the root directory:
  ```sh
  pylint --rcfile=pylintrc orbitpy tests examples
  ```

- Run `black` to format the python files.
  ```sh
  black orbitpy tests examples
  ```
- Run `coverage`. The HTML report will be generated in the htmlcov directory. Open htmlcov/index.html in a web browser to view the detailed coverage report.
    ```sh
    coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests
    coverage html
    ```

- Use Google style docstrings.  https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html. The following configuration option in the `conf.py` enables Sphinx to parse Google style dosctrings:  `napoleon_google_docstring = True`

- All OrbitPy objects (classes) intended for use by external users must support initialization and serialization using Python dictionaries. Each class should provide `from_dict(...)` and `to_dict(...)` methods to allow instantiation from dictionary inputs and export their state or data back into a dictionary format.

- Only classes and functions which are most commonly utiized in Earth Observation mission simulations will be developed.

- All enum values should be in capital letters and formatted with underscores, e.g., `GREGORIAN_DATE`.

- Imports of classes and/or functions from external libraries must be prefixed by the name of the external library. For example:
  ```python
  from astropy.time import Time as Astropy_Time
  ```

- Use only the `from_dict(...)` and other functions that do not depend on external libraries to initialize the OrbitPy objects, even in test functions. External library members should be kept internal to the implementation, as they may change.

- A class representing a physical object (e.g., Ground-station, instrument) or a collection of objects (e.g., grid of physical locations) must include an identifier attribute which must be a valid UUID. If no identifier is provided, one will be autogenerated. Providing names of entities will be optional.

- Python dictionaries used for interfacing will have lowercase, underscore-separated keys. Avoid including units in keys for physical quantities. Examples: `min_elevation_angle`, `latitude` (not `latitude_deg`). The class variable names will be descriptive and have units.
