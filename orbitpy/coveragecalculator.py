        Uses the coverage kinematics library (C++) for coverage calculation. The following
        concepts are relevant to understanding the implementation:

        Source<T>: An object which satisfies the Source interface defines a "get" method,
        which takes the simulation time index as input and returns a reference to an object
        of type T.

        Variable: An object which satisfies the Variable interface represents a quantity which
        must be updated over the course of the simulation. Variable objects define an "update"
        method, which takes the simulation time index as input and updates the object for that
        time step.

        Args:
            target_point_array (Cartesian3DPositionArray): An array of target points in a Cartesian
                coordinate system.
            fov (Union[CircularFieldOfView, RectangularFieldOfView]): The field of view to use for
                coverage calculation.
            frame_graph (FrameGraph): The frame graph containing the necessary transformations
                between frames.
            times (AbsoluteDateArray): An array of time points for which the coverage is to be
                calculated at discrete instances.
            surface (SurfaceType): The type of surface to consider for coverage calculation.
                Defaults to SurfaceType.SPHERE. Surface type will affect the horizon check, which
                checks that the points are not occluded by the surface. Points are not necessarily
                required to be on the surface. Surface is assumed to be fixed to the frame of the
                target points.
            buff_size (int): Specifies the buffer size for parallel computation. For optimal
                performance, it should be at least equal to the number of CPU cores available
                on the executing machine.
        Returns:
            DiscreteCoverageTP: An object reporting the grid points covered at each time point.
